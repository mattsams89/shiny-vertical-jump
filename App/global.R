# artifacts at the phase change points. Maybe it's supposed to look a little

# for braking and propulsion with the final point from the previous phase and
# increase the length.out by 1. I immediately remove the first interpolated
# value, however, to avoid duplicating the value in the returned vector. This
# also has the side effect of making the resultant vector the correct length.
